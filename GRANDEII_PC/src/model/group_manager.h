 * @author giangvu
 * @date 2025-04-21
 * @brief Interface for managing multiple light groups in a lighting control system.
 *
 * This module defines the `GroupManager` structure and a set of functions to create, add,
 * assign, remove, and manage multiple `Group` instances. It acts as a high-level manager
 * coordinating the behavior and lifecycle of several groups of lights.
 *
 * @note This module builds upon the `Group` structure and functions defined in `group.h`.
